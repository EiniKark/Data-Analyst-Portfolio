## Project Description:
This project analyzes fire incident data across various locations in California, focusing on the impact of fires on different types of structures. The dataset includes details such as damage levels, location information (street, city, zip code), structure types, construction materials, and fire response actions. The goal is to uncover trends in fire damage, identify vulnerable areas, and evaluate the effectiveness of fire response strategies.

## Key Questions to Answer:
**Damage Analysis:**

- What is the distribution of damage levels (no damage, minor, major, destroyed) across different types of structures?

- Which types of structures are most frequently affected by fire incidents?

**Geographical Analysis:**

- Which cities or counties have the highest number of fire incidents?

- Are there specific areas or neighborhoods that are more prone to fire damage?

**Structural Analysis:**

- What are the most common construction materials used in structures that were affected by fires?

- How does the type of construction material (e.g., wood, stucco, metal) correlate with the extent of damage?

**Temporal Analysis:**

- Are there specific months or years with a higher frequency of fire incidents?

- How has the frequency and severity of fire incidents changed over time?

**Fire Response Analysis:**

- What are the most common actions taken during fire incidents (e.g., hand crew fuel break, fire retardant drop)?

- How effective are different fire response actions in mitigating damage?

**Property Value Analysis:**

- Is there a correlation between the assessed value of a property and the extent of fire damage?

- How does the year a property was built affect its vulnerability to fire damage?

**Utility and Commercial Structures:**

- What is the impact of fire incidents on utility and commercial structures compared to residential structures?

- Are there specific types of utility or commercial structures that are more vulnerable to fire damage?

**Community and Battalion Analysis:**

- Which communities or battalions have the highest number of fire incidents?

- How does the response time or resources of different battalions affect the outcome of fire incidents?

**Fire Origin and Cause:**

- What are the most common causes of fire incidents (e.g., direct flame impingement, embers)?

- Where do most fires start (e.g., deck, siding, attached fence)?

**Long-term Impact:**

- What is the long-term impact of fire incidents on property values and community development?

- How do fire incidents affect the insurance rates and rebuilding efforts in affected areas?
